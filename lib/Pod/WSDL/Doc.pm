=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pod::WSDL::Doc;
  my $doc = new Pod::WSDL::Doc('_DOC This method is for blah ...');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you have to interact directly with it. If that is the case, take a look at the code, it is rather simple.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new Pod::WSDL::Attr. The method needs one parameter, the documentation string from the pod. Please see SYNOPSIS or the section "Pod Syntax" in the description of Pod::WSDL.

=head1 EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
