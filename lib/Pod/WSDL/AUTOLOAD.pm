=head1 NAME

Pod::WSDL::AUTOLOAD - Base class for autoloading (internal use only)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;
  our @ISA = qw/Pod::WSDL::AUTOLOAD/;

  sub new {
    my $pgk = shift;
    bless {
  	  _bar => 'blah',
    }, $pgk
  }

  package main;
  use Foo;
  
  my $foo = new Foo();
  print $foo->bar;  # prints 'blah'
  
  $foo->bar('bloerch');  # sets _bar to 'bloerch'
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you have to interact directly with it. The Pod::WSDL::AUTOLOADER is used as a base class and handels autoloading of accessor methods. If there is a property called _foo in a hash based blessed reference, it will allow the use of the method 'foo' as a getter and setter. As a getter is returns the value of _foo, as a setter it sets _foo with the argument and returns the object. You can exclude the accessor by using a hash %FORBIDDEN_METHODS in the derived class like that:

  our %FORBIDDEN_METHODS = (
	foo => {get => 1, set => 0},
	bar => {get => 0, set => 0}
  );

In this example it will not be allowed to set _foo and to set or get _bar. If the user of the object tries to do so, it croaks. From within the objects package every accessor is allowed.
