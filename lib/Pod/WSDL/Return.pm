=head1 NAME

Pod::WSDL::Return - Represents the WSDL pod for the return value of a method (internal use only)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pod::WSDL::Return;
  my $return = new Pod::WSDL::Return('_RETURN $string This returns blah ...');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you have to interact directly with it. If that is the case, take a look at the code, it is rather simple.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new Pod::WSDL::Param. The method needs one parameter, the _RETURN string from the pod. Please see SYNOPSIS or the section "Pod Syntax" in the description of Pod::WSDL.
