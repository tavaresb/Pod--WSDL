=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pod::WSDL::Fault;
  my $fault = new Pod::WSDL::Fault('_FAULT My::Fault This happens if something happens');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you have to interact directly with it. If that is the case, take a look at the code, it is rather simple.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new Pod::WSDL::Fault. The method needs one parameter, the fault string from the pod. Please see SYNOPSIS or the section "Pod Syntax" in the description of Pod::WSDL.
